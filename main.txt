Pseudocode of BFS 
==================

Input -> Converted Graph and a "Source"
Output -> Traverse all nodes and print the Traversal order

BFS( graph, source ):

- Initiate an array called " visited " and an empty queue "q" 
- mark visited[source] = 1 and q.push( source )
- while the queue is not empty:
    - head = q.front()
    - q.pop()
    - print the node "head"
    - for all adjacent node of "head":
        - if visited[ adj_node ] == 0:
            -visited[adj_node] = 1 and q.push( adj_node )
